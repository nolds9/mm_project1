### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations** It looks like you mapped out your scope early, came up with great user stories, and planned your bronze, silver, and gold versions, and went to working evolving your MVP - well done! As we start working on larger applications in the future, it would be great to include your wireframes, ERDs, and any task tracking such as Trello as part of the planning process.

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations** Congratulations, your project shows prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! Very much on the borderline of "Exceeds" here, just would like to see more evidence of how you are pushing yourself.

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations** Nice and clean! Code was well-structured (yay objects!) and included great code comments.  Please review my inline code comments (prefixed with my initials - `NHO`) for suggestions.

* __Problem Solving__:

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** Excellent job breaking down this prompt into small, accomplishable chunks as evidenced by your planning documentation and from your clear understanding of the problem. I really liked how you made it looks like you had fun with this project and encourage you to come back to this to implement and wish-list features outlined in your gold version!
